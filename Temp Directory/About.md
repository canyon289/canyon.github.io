#Why am I making this blog
I'll start with an embarrasing admission. 
I'm tired of failing data science interviews. Data Science is great because
it covers so much, statistics, programming, independent and abstract thinking,
and communication
but that also makes interviews especially difficult because you quickly have 
to be able to demonstrate profieciency in any of those fields to ironically
pass a subjective interview.

This leads to my second  admission
