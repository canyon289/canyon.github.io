In this blog I will post every single data science question I've been asked
during an interview, along with the context, and an in depth solution.
All code will be posted on Github.

If you are practising for a Data Science Interview I would advise that you
try and recreate the situation as best as possible. For instance 
if the question was asked during a phone interview, ask your friend to call
you, and work the solution over the phone with him or her.

I also will be using questions I've found online on Glassdoor or other sites.
After some time I hope this sites grows to become a useful point of practice
for anyone else looking to get into the field! 

If you have suggestions for questions please feel free to open up advise
Github issue to let me know!
